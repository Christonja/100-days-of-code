# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 14, Tuesday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the start of PSET3 from HarvardX CS50. Not to mention deciding to start the 100 Days of Code challenge

**Thoughts** 
Spent a bulk of the time understanding the requirements of PSET3 which requires the implementation of 3 helper functions to fill out the application for reading and playing music. I've implemented the first one, but by the time I read through the helper and associated C files, as well as write out the happy birthday song in ASCII I had to head off to work. However will continue tomorrow. 

I'm excited about working through the 100 Days Of Code challenge primarily to help me see how far I am travelling in my coding journey. I don't necessarily need the motivation or anything to keep me in check. But I'm finding myself getting discouraged when I finish a coding session and get far less done than planned. I look forward to using this challenge as something that encourages me and reminds me that I'm achieving and learning.

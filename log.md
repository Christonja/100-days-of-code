# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 14, Tuesday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the start of PSET3 from HarvardX CS50. Not to mention deciding to start the 100 Days of Code challenge

**Thoughts**:
Spent a bulk of the time understanding the requirements of PSET3 which requires the implementation of 3 helper functions to fill out the application for reading and playing music. I've implemented the first one, but by the time I read through the helper and associated C files, as well as write out the happy birthday song in ASCII I had to head off to work. However will continue tomorrow. 

I'm excited about working through the 100 Days Of Code challenge primarily to help me see how far I am travelling in my coding journey. I don't necessarily need the motivation or anything to keep me in check. But I'm finding myself getting discouraged when I finish a coding session and get far less done than planned. I look forward to using this challenge as something that encourages me and reminds me that I'm achieving and learning.

### Day 2: August 15, Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the bulk of PSET3 from HarvardX CS50. Generally speaking it was an uphill battle, that after 4 hours I completed the frequency function and it worked perfectly through running notes and it evaluated fine in check50. Only problem was I didn't implement the duration and is_rest functions 100% and now I'm out of time, so will try again next week! Back to FreeCodeCamp tomorrow.

**Thoughts**:
I found the work today to be very hard work. CS50 is thoroughly enjoyable and an incredible programming course. However it moves at quite a pace. I think it will take me a bit longer than the 11 weeks it says it runs for. But thats OK. My goal is to have it done by the end of the year. So I think I'll just aim for that at this stage! 

### Day 3: August 16, Thursday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fumbling through the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting exercises on FreeCodeCamp. I only had the 1 hour to spare today, and kinda feel a little bit disappointed with my efforts. However I did solidify (in part) my OO knowledge and learned more about return functions so that's something!  

**Thoughts**: The intermediate algorithm challenges, I'm finding are significantly harder than the basic ones. I'm often having to check the hints and in some cases, look at the solutions. As soon as I do that I completely understand it (I think!). Nonetheless, as soon as I've finished this section I'll be going straight back through it because I don't think it's wise to move onto the projects section coming up next if I can't do the intermediate challenges. 

### Day 4: August 17, Friday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the intermediate algorithm challenges, now giving the final projects a crack. Got stuck into the first one. Seems relatively simple (Well.. by that I mean I managed to get most tests to pass on first attempt), however ran out of time to complete it.

**Thoughts**: With Free Code Camp there seems this trend with alot of the JavaScript challenges, where it's easy to get a few tests to pass but hard to get all of them to pass. I appreciate this as you're not always going to be working with the input data you would normally expect so being able to work with different types is a very good way to learn. I also at least with this first JavaScript project based on my time with it thus far, it seems simpler than many of the intermediate JavaScript challenges. My speculation is that the next ones ramp up significantly. Whichever way, I'll definitely be going back through the intermediate challenges to have another crack. 

### Day 5: August 18, Saturday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the first project which was to create a palindrome checker, I'm proud of myself on this one, because I didn't need to check any hints, I used my own resources to figure it out. Then I moved onto the Roman Numerals which I'm finding a struggle. I'll get there, of course, but I think I'll need a bit more help with this one. 

**Thoughts**: I'm finding manipulating strings with regex's, splitting and joining them, iteration all that fun stuff to be some of my favorite challenges in freeCodeCamp, it's just everything else that's the issue! I'm getting there just been quite bogged down with other things has been over a week since I've had a solid block of time to code like a good 4 hours is ideal for me. Tomorrow I should be able to make some good progress.

### Day 6: August 19, Sunday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Roman Numeral Converter, and Caesars Cipher on FreeCodeCamp, started the telephone number checker which I almost got working well, except it has such a large amount of test data and I keep failing at least 3 of them. But I've run out of time so will have a proper look next week. Tomorrow I'm back to C programming which fundly enough had a Caesar's cipher challenge a couple weeks ago!  

**Thoughts**: Not too much to say today, struggled to find time today as I don't normally code on Sunday. In the future I think I'll just do an hour on Sunday as Sunday tends to be my 'get everything I didn't do during the week done day' ie. housework and phone reminders, plus I kinda want to relax which I think is pretty normal for a Sunday. Nonetheless was a solid day and I'm pretty happy with my efforts.

### Day 7: August 20, Monday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished and checked the music program in CS50

**Thoughts**: Not much time today to do anything, but happy to have finished the music program now just a few final things to do before moving on to the next weeks work. 

### Day 8: August 21, Tuesday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Telephone number validator on Free Code Camp, very complex regular expression (At least out of what I've come across), but eventually figured out where I was going wrong, I needed to use the ? syntax to represent where there was 1 or 0 of something. Because of the sample data some options had 1 or 0 spaces, or 1 or zero hyphens etc. and both had to be accepted. 

**Thoughts**: Just managed to get my hour in today. Been a hectic few days, but loving the 100 days of code challenge, keeping me coding in amongst it all!

### Day 9: August 22, Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent the morning on the next unit in CS50 on edX, however did not do any coding as was watching the lecture and shorts. In the afternoon got in an hour of coding on Free Code Camp, maybe half way through the final Javascript challenge..

**Thoughts**: Actually quite proud of how far I got through this final challenge "Cash Register" before getting stumped. But not stumped because I don't know what to do next per se, but stumped because I completely misred part of the challenge, I didn't realise I needed to use the cash register values to return the change to give to the customer, I thought that was only for the other parts of the challenge. But of course I need to use the values! duh! anyway tomorrow I'll go back through my algorithm and adjust for using the cash register values instead. I'm just worried that I'll struggle with it. But not to worry I'll get there! 

### Day 10: August 23, Thursday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the freeCodeCamp challenge Cash Register. Took just as long to comment my code as it did to fix it after what I did yesterday!

**Thoughts**: Excited to move onto the next part of freeCodeCamp, however I feel I need to run through some of the challenges etc again before moving on to far.

### Day 11: August 24, Friday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Ran through the Bootstrap challenges on freeCodeCamp, was pretty enjoyable to see the simplicity of bootstrap and the amount a few lines of code can do. I also updated my website to reflect the new projects I'd done. 

**Thoughts**: I found the Bootstrap challenges fun however I'm a little uncomfortable about how much Bootstrap hides from someone learning web design and development. I appreciate it's an incredible resource, however it feels a little constrained like if you want to use bootstrap, you have use it throughout, it doesn't seem like you can just use it in some places. Maybe I'm wrong will investigate another day. I mean the responsive layout stuff is excellent. Also I'm having issues getting my website to not overflow by 10 pixels. I spent an hour investigating, however have not resolved. Annoying!

### Day 12: August 25, Saturday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Going back through the freeCodeCamp OO and functional programming sections to solidify my learning a bit. 

**Thoughts**: It's taking much longer than I expected, It's a little troubling how much I've forgotten from the first time around, however I also remember alot too so I guess it's just how learning works =P

### Day 13: August 26, Sunday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Brushing up on my functional programming in FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**: That reduce function is one serious function!

### Day 14: August 27, Monday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished brushing up on my functional programming in FreeCodeCamp, now doing the JavaScript intermediate challenges again! 

**Thoughts**: The intermediate challenges, are, very hard.. but at the same time.. I thoroughly enjoy them.. especially when you realise, hang on! I can just do this instead of 100 lines of code! I feel like doing them again has been greatly helpful thus far. 

### Day 15: August 28, Tuesday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working through the Whodunit challenge in CS50

**Thoughts**: CS50's challenges tend to be extremely intimidating, but then you read what's required and it's generally much less than what it appears. I'm not sure what their aim is in making challenges like this, but my guess is that it's to help students understand how their code fits into part of a greater program and what that may look like. Further how to read code and add onto something that already exists, as you may have to do in the real world. Nonetheless, I'm enjoying it, and excited to see whodunit haha!

### Day 16: August 29, Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished Whodunit and struggling through the resize challenge in CS50

**Thoughts**: Whodunit was simple enough once I knew what was going on. Resize remains as difficult as all hell. However I'm sure I'll eventually get there. However thus far, it's the first CS50 task that I have literally no idea if what I'm doing is even remotely the right way to go about it. 

### Day 17: August 30, Thursday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working through FCC Javascript challenges, continuing to find them hard, but not as hard as the first time around.

**Thoughts**: It's slowly becomming more intuitive, unfortunately some of these challenges I'm having to look at example solutions to figure out, however I'm finding I only need a couple of clues as opposed to a large chunk of clues. I feel like I'm progressing! Also late code session, as had literally no time today :/ 

### Day 18 and 19: August 31 and September 1, Fri-Sat, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished my Ruby on Rails tutorial kindly provided for free here: [link](https://upskillcourses.com/p/essential-web-developer-course)

**Thoughts**: Forgot to write my journal for yesterday, so seeing as I was doing the exact same thing today I figured it was sensible to simply put both days together. 

This tutorial I found very hard. I will write a blog about it later, however for me I feel like I learned alot about Ruby on Rails but certainly not enough to create my own app with it as the tutorial claims to allow someone to be able to do. However early on in the tutorial I decided that that's not what I wanted to get out of it. More I wanted a deep dive into Ruby on Rails, to explore what technologies are used when working with ecommerce and pushing a site live, what it's like to use GitHub regularly for frequent commit's and working with Amazon Web Services. Which unfortunately had to move away from and instead use my old laptop which I installed lubuntu on and then ruby and rails and a billion other things to get working, but it worked well once all was said and done. 

But I ended up learning alot about an array of different web technologies and linux, and for that I would recommend this course.

### Day 20: September 2, Sun, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Struggling through the Javascript challenges in FCC.

**Thoughts**: I feel like I'm better than I was the first time around, but gee they are hard! I just want to be able to implement them without checking a solution. I don't mind if I have to research functions etc. But if I have to check an example solution that to me means I cheated. I'm getting there, but like at the speed of 1 algorithm an hour. When there's alot of algorithms to go through, this feels slow.. but I'm progressing. 

### Day 21: September 3, Mon, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continuing through Javascript challenges in FCC.

**Thoughts**: Regular expressions are hard sometimes. Fun though. 

### Day 22: September 4, Tue, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished Resize in CS50

**Thoughts**: Absolute nightmare, learned alot, however just seemed like such an excessively difficult challenge as an introduction to file pointers. Why couldn't we just read from one text file and write to another then work toward this? Nonetheless, I learned alot so what's it matter?

### Day 23: September 5, Wed, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished Recover in CS50

**Thoughts**: Muuuch better than Resize, still very hard. I feel like this should've been the challenge that we started with as I feel it was a much better introduction to file pointers etc. than Resize was. Admittedly this week's course material made me feel stupid, and like I'm not cut out for the course. I mean I don't necessarily mean I'm an idiot and can't learn C. But maybe the delivery method is not for me. I'm making solid progress in freeCodeCamp and if I need to revise material, I have zero problem doing so and I have a solid grasp on what I need to revise and what I feel I know well enough to move on from. Whereas in CS50 I feel like I reached a point and now it's all just blurry and hard to grasp. Further I feel the learning method in CS50 is just not quite my style. Like the long winded video format is just not for me. freeCodeCamp has a bit of text, a bit of learning, a bit of text and a bit of learning, and so on. Like each little chunk of learning is very succinct and understandable and graded as pass/fail. Like instead of having to implement an entire program, you simply learn one little method, implement it, then learn another one. Then at the end you use these methods to implement a project. This is where it all ties together. Not having it all tie together when you don't know any of it yet. 

I think my learning method is one of learn in parts then synthesize together. Not synthesize together whilst learning on the go. I appreciate everyone learns differently and I'll definitely crack on with CS50 as aside from me realising it's not quite my learning style, it is an amazing course! EVERYONE SHOULD GIVE IT A GO if they like programming. Just I don't know if I'll pursue further courses of this style moving forward or not :/ we'll see? I might get used to it :)

### Day 24: September 6, Thurs, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Free Code Camp Javascript challenges

**Thoughts**: I find anything to do with string manipulation, at least in these challenges, faaar easier than anything to do with arrays... at least in these challenges. 

### Day 25: September 7, Fri, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Free Code Camp Javascript challenges

**Thoughts**: Definitely better at these the second time around.. as you would hope :)

### Day 26: September 8, Sat, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I studied FCC.

**Thoughts**: Achieved almost nothing today.. attempting to sum primes is frustrating

### Day 27: September 9, Sun, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Further FCC Study

**Thoughts**: Figured out (mostly) how to do the sum of the primes in a nice but certainly not (according to research) the recommended way. Not fussed though, I'll learn the recommended way later. 

### Day 28: September 10, Mon, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Couple more JavaScript FCC challenges

**Thoughts**: I suck at recursion.

### Day 29: September 11, Tue, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Couple more JavaScript FCC challenges

**Thoughts**: Went through these ones much easier than some of the other challenges. That being said, I found these ones easier the first time around too. Getting there! 

### Day 30: September 12, Wed, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Couple more JavaScript FCC challenges

**Thoughts**: These ones were a little harder, however much easier than the first time I went through them. As can be seen I am writing very little here each day. For the past week, this should change soon as I have started a new job, therefore am scraping the minimum daily requirements for #100DaysOfCode and have only been managing an hour a day the past week. As I get back on my feet a bit more this weekend and beyond it will extend to more work/day, however on the days I work it may very well not, at least not for a little while longer. Nonetheless, I'll certainly continue to do 1 hour a day =P

### Day 31: September 13, Thurs, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished off the intermediate javascript challenges now back onto the final challenges

**Thoughts**: Ugh, I feel like in some areas, I've greatly developed my skills, but today I feel like, atleast in some areas, I may have gotten worse? Maybe I'm just tired -_-

### Day 32: September 14, Fri, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the palindrome checker, roman numeral converter, caesar's cipher and telephone number validator in FCC

**Thoughts**: Well, I must just had been tired yesterday, because I just smashed through four of the five javascript projects, maybe 20 minutes each. Admittedly I remembered some of the key parts of the projects from my first run through hence helping greatly in my second run through. Although is this not simply how one learns? Remembering how to implement algorithms? As long as I know logically aswell as syntactically what I'm doing, it can form a basis to extrapolate to new algorithms and new implementations.. I hope. Nonetheless proud of my efforts today. 

I also listened to the next CS50 lecture, which I've been a bit slack on, on account of I simply prefer the delivery method of FCC to CS50. Nonetheless the content of both is equally as interesting so... 

### Day 33: September 15, Sat, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the cash register a second time, implemented a little differently now back to the front end libraries :) 

**Thoughts**: Was interesting to run through a large amount of the Javascript stuff again. I felt it really helped, and although I could probably do with even more work solidifying my knowledge here, I feel that many people could say that sort of thing, therefore at this point moving on seems the most sensible option. I managed to implement each of the final projects again, this time without looking at any solutions. For me, that feels look as good a sign as any, that I can move on if I want to... and I really want to get into the front end stuff! 

### Day 34: September 16, Sun, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Ran through the JQuery and Sass topics on Free Code Camp 

**Thoughts**: Very interesting to see how using these can make life muuuch simpler when working with HTML and CSS.. provided you know the syntax! 

### Day 35: September 17, Mon, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started the React tutorials on FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**: Excited to to finally learn what I always refered to as 'the language that seems to smash HTML and Javascript together'. 

### Day 36: September 18, Tue, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working further through the React tutorials on FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**: Very interesting, feels very JavaScript OO meets HTML. Syntax is a little convoluted, yet.. sensible and I can tell what it's achieving and how it's making things more intuitive etc. But gosh will take some time to get a handle on it I think :/ 

### Day 37: September 21, Fri, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working further through the React tutorials on FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**: Missed a couple of days of coding, I've started a new job and although I do plan to study after work, the last couple of days I had other things on and by the time I finished those things, I was so tired the idea of studying even just for an hour seemed like the worst thing in the world, and also pointless because I'd probably fall asleep at my desk. Which bought the question up of is it better to push through anyway for integrity of the challenge, or leave it till the next day for integrity of the learning experience. 

For example, today felt productive because I was awake and I went over alot of my react learning and it's feels quite reinforced at this point. However had I gone over it last night or the night before I don't think that would've been the case. Potentially I could've studied or coded 'something else'. Maybe that's what I'll do next time? Anyway. For now it's all a learning experience and today felt productive so, we're back on track with React :) 

### Day 38: September 22, Sat, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working further through the React tutorials on FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**: So I only managed a measly hour today. It turns out I have some health problems I need to sort out, so.. my extra studies are going to have to remain minimal for now. I will still do the hour a day, however, I'm concerned about my health and feel I should take it easy for a couple of weeks before spending too much time coding. Instead I will focus more on my lifestyle changes like exercise and eating better and sorting out possible issues with high blood pressure. Probably smart anyway as I have recently started a new job which is stressful enough and although I do enjoy the extracurricular study, It can be stressful if I'm struggling with a concept or something. So for now, it'll likely be kept to a minimum. However the beauty of 100daysofcode is it keeps you going even for just an hour a day, which I feel is manageable. 

### Day 39: September 23, Sun, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working further through the React tutorials on FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**: Not much to say today, managed an hour or so, finding I get more distracted only allocating an hour than I do allocating heaps of hours. I guess 1 hour doesn't quite give enough time to get a good flow going, at least not for me. Nonetheless, if I plan an hour and get sidetracked, I go for longer to make up for it.

### Day 40: September 24, Mon, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working further through the React tutorials on FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**: Getting more convuluted everyday! Like I say... it makes sense. But still. It's a whole new level of abstraction I wasn't ready for. 

### Day 41: September 25, Tue, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working further through the React tutorials on FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**: Hmm.. the more I do it, the more I grasp it.. but I still feel 20 steps behind where I should be!

### Day 42: September 26, Wed, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finally finished the React tutorials on FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**: Took me a while, but I got there, was interesting to learn about it and see how different the syntax is from standard JavaScript, it really is a mish mash of JavaScript, HTML and CSS if they all joined together and formed one mega language. At least that's how a newbie like me see's it! Will be interesting to see what the Redux challenges are like, but for now will leave it there as I'm sleepy and if I start something new I'll probably end up going over it all again tomorrow. 

### Day 43: September 28, Fri, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Halfway through the Redux challenges on FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**: Hmm, a little bit more intuitive, yet still abstract and hard to understand. I imagine it will come together a bit easier when these technologies are implemented in a few real examples. 

### Day 44: September 30, Sun, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Almost completed the Redux challenges in FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**: Got bogged down today implementing the counter function in Redux. It was difficult, but a great learning experience. I find the challenges that attempt to get me to implement more are the ones that I learn the most in. However I often refer to the challenges that only got me to implement little bits at a time as a way to help to know what to implement in these later challenges, so it all works together =P

### Day 45: October 5, Fri, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished off the Redux challenges in FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**: Starting to get my head around it all so hopefully it can all be a little more understandable with the upcoming Redux + React challenges. Should be interesting O.o Also I appreciate at this stage I've basically failed my 100DaysOfCode challenge. However I've decided to take things easy for a while and focus just on my new job and relaxing whilst I get my blood pressure sorted out. I find medical things to be stressful and my health is always my priority. So I guess I can't say I've coded everyday for the past 100 days, but at this stage I'm not too concerned about that, I just want to reach 100 days of coding even if it takes 150 days or so. At this stage, for me it's more about my personal goals and achievements and I feel like if I can complete this challenge, even if it takes longer than it's supposed to; if I learn from my mistakes and can take a look at where I came from and where I got to, if I can grow in passion and enjoyment and knowledge of coding thanks to my participation in this challenge, then that's the main thing. 

### Day 46: October 6, Sat, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working through the React and Redux challenges in FCC

**Thoughts**: Every time I sit down and work through these challenges, it makes a little more sense each time. Certainly not enough for me to be confident in what I'm doing.. but I'm slowly beginning to grasp all this state management stuff and operating on the state of a program instead of a global one time run only program. It's interesting. But also.. gosh an uphill battle.. but that's how learning happens, that's why I'm doing this in the first place, to push myself to learn something that I never thought I was smart enough to learn. 

### Day 47: October 7, Sun, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the React/Redux challenges in FCC

**Thoughts**: Very interesting, alot to take on however! Have looked ahead at what the front end projects are like.. I'm a little intimidated, however will give it my best crack. When I did the html/css challenges I tried to make the end result look alot like the example just as a basis of what to get to. This time, I might just focus on the functionality side of things and just seek to make something that functions as it's supposed to... then maybe make it look pretty if I feel like doing so.  

### Day 48: October 8, Mon, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started work on Speller in CS50

**Thoughts**: Not much to say, but been doing FCC so much lately it's nice to take a break with CS50. 

### Day 49: October 13, Sat, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on Speller

**Thoughts**: Got it to compile however appears to be some very logical problems. Will have to investigate further at a later stage.

### Day 50: October 15, Mon, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on Speller

**Thoughts**: Changed alot of things after realising some clear problems, I think my main issue is I barely understand what I'm actually doing. I'm going to need to run back through some of the coursework to get a better grasp of things :(

### Day 51: October 19, Fri, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on Speller

**Thoughts**: This challenge makes me feel like a dimwit who isn't smart enough to learn programming. I'm very slowly getting there though. But still.. CS50 is ridiculously difficult for an online introductory programming course. I appreciate we're supposed to use other resources etc. to learn, but still.. It, to me feels like a C refresher course, like for people who know C but need to brush up on it or something. meh. I'll get there. 

### Day 52: October 20, Sat, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished speller

**Thoughts**: Got there in the end, I still feel like a dimwit because it took me so long, but I suppose that's how learning sometimes feels for concepts particularly verbose and overwhelming. I guess of level of tenacity is required, and it seems that's where the learning occurs. I mean it's not the best solution. But it compiles and passes the checks. So that's the main thing.

### Day 53: November 3, Sat, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started the free code camp front end library challenges. Only to realise I have no idea what I'm doing. Hence deciding to start the front end libraries cert all over again.

**Thoughts**: After getting through the redux/react stuff, my knowledge of JSON and SASS and bootstrap aswell to some degree completely left me. What I'll do this time is get up to the JSON and SASS stuff and do these, then attempt the first challenge again, then run through react/redux again and try the next challenge with this. Then the remainder, simply do whatever makes the most sense to me.

### Day 54 and 55: November 10, Fri-Sat, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Decided to start learning Android development and have started a free google created course on Udacity and I'm really enjoying it so far. I also have restarted the front end libraries cert on FCC as I took a big break from it and feel I've forgotten too much, I'm really enjoying the process of solidifying my learning with it. 

**Thoughts**: Will be interesting to see how the Android dev learning goes as I'd like to get an app up and running through my learning. I feel the learning experience will be an encouraging one as it's common for people to make apps from start to finish by themselves and as a self directed learner I would like to see an app of my own come to fruition. If I'm able to say "I made this and people can see and appreciate it", that's a significant yes moment which I feel will help me moving forward. 

### Day 56: November 26, Mon, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continuing through learning Android development

**Thoughts**: Very interesting indeed, starting to make alot of sense and I'm starting to draw similarities between XML and HTML.

### Day 57: December 8, Sat, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Ran through JQuery again in FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**: Was fun getting back into JQuery and FreeCodeCamp also. I know I'm not doing this 100DaysOfCode properly anymore. But if it's going to help me occasionally code. Then that, to me is better than not at all. Because I do enjoy coding, but I've just been going through things and it's kinda hard to keep motivated. 

### Day 58: December 10, Mon, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued with Android coding via Udacity

**Thoughts**: Started using Android Studio, excited to get started!

### Day 59: December 14, Fri, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Ran through FreeCodeCamp Sass again. Now onto the first project!

**Thoughts**: Not much to think about, other than it being helpful as a refresher to quickly run through again, it's a short set of challenges with good info so worth doing a few times I think.

### Day 60: December 15, Sat, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Onto my first FCC project of the Front end projects. aaand it's near impossible for me.. but I'll get there.

**Thoughts**: I guess being the free course that Free Code camp is I can't expect everything. But I mean I have zero issues with the challenges. But the projects are basically like leagues beyond any of the challenges. I just feel like it doesn't give you enough before sending you out on your own with the projects. Nonetheless it gives the opportunity to research and learn and using alternative resources so.. it's fine.

### Day 61: December 17, Mon, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Starting (trying) to make my very first Android 'Hello World' App.. But failing hard

**Thoughts**: Struggling as my old android phone new android phone don't want to accept the android studio sending through the app for testing. Even though I've done all the right things. 

Will need to debug next time I'm doing the course.. but one of these days.. 'fingers crossed' something will work the way it says on the tin. 

### Day 62: December 27, Thurs, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Managed to make the Hello World app and the subsequent Happy Birthday card which I'm very happy with.

**Thoughts**: Found all my initial issues were with the initial code given by the tutorial I was following, just was refusing to compile, found on the net people had the same issue and once I fixed it I was able to move on. Funny thing was, in the next video the tutor just removed that code anyway!

### Day 63: January 04, Fri, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Stoked to have completed the random quote generator in FCC

**Thoughts**: So proud of myself, had an aha moment when I realised that I could input the quotes via the .html() function in jQuery, the rest was trial and error and solid googling, plus of course prior knowledge, but anyway. Happy as I feel like I've accomplished something and haven't felt that way in my coding for a while now.

### Day 64: January 11, Fri, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished Udacity's course on Android Basics: User Interface

**Thoughts**: I enjoy android development because you can reach an end product quite quickly. I mean you can with alot of things, but android and phone development in general feels very quick and often relatable and practical. I enjoy all of my coding endeavours but android feels like the one I'm likely to get proficient at the earliest. At least at a practical level. It's enjoyable, it's encouraging. It's nice to have in my toolkit with all my other coding endeavours. There's still a project to do, and to be honest, I'm looking forward to doing it!

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 14, Tuesday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the start of PSET3 from HarvardX CS50. Not to mention deciding to start the 100 Days of Code challenge

**Thoughts**:
Spent a bulk of the time understanding the requirements of PSET3 which requires the implementation of 3 helper functions to fill out the application for reading and playing music. I've implemented the first one, but by the time I read through the helper and associated C files, as well as write out the happy birthday song in ASCII I had to head off to work. However will continue tomorrow. 

I'm excited about working through the 100 Days Of Code challenge primarily to help me see how far I am travelling in my coding journey. I don't necessarily need the motivation or anything to keep me in check. But I'm finding myself getting discouraged when I finish a coding session and get far less done than planned. I look forward to using this challenge as something that encourages me and reminds me that I'm achieving and learning.

### Day 2: August 15, Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the bulk of PSET3 from HarvardX CS50. Generally speaking it was an uphill battle, that after 4 hours I completed the frequency function and it worked perfectly through running notes and it evaluated fine in check50. Only problem was I didn't implement the duration and is_rest functions 100% and now I'm out of time, so will try again next week! Back to FreeCodeCamp tomorrow.

**Thoughts**:
I found the work today to be very hard work. CS50 is thoroughly enjoyable and an incredible programming course. However it moves at quite a pace. I think it will take me a bit longer than the 11 weeks it says it runs for. But thats OK. My goal is to have it done by the end of the year. So I think I'll just aim for that at this stage! 

### Day 3: August 16, Thursday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fumbling through the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting exercises on FreeCodeCamp. I only had the 1 hour to spare today, and kinda feel a little bit disappointed with my efforts. However I did solidify (in part) my OO knowledge and learned more about return functions so that's something!  

**Thoughts**: The intermediate algorithm challenges, I'm finding are significantly harder than the basic ones. I'm often having to check the hints and in some cases, look at the solutions. As soon as I do that I completely understand it (I think!). Nonetheless, as soon as I've finished this section I'll be going straight back through it because I don't think it's wise to move onto the projects section coming up next if I can't do the intermediate challenges. 

### Day 4: August 17, Friday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the intermediate algorithm challenges, now giving the final projects a crack. Got stuck into the first one. Seems relatively simple (Well.. by that I mean I managed to get most tests to pass on first attempt), however ran out of time to complete it.

**Thoughts**: With Free Code Camp there seems this trend with alot of the JavaScript challenges, where it's easy to get a few tests to pass but hard to get all of them to pass. I appreciate this as you're not always going to be working with the input data you would normally expect so being able to work with different types is a very good way to learn. I also at least with this first JavaScript project based on my time with it thus far, it seems simpler than many of the intermediate JavaScript challenges. My speculation is that the next ones ramp up significantly. Whichever way, I'll definitely be going back through the intermediate challenges to have another crack. 

### Day 5: August 18, Saturday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the first project which was to create a palindrome checker, I'm proud of myself on this one, because I didn't need to check any hints, I used my own resources to figure it out. Then I moved onto the Roman Numerals which I'm finding a struggle. I'll get there, of course, but I think I'll need a bit more help with this one. 

**Thoughts**: I'm finding manipulating strings with regex's, splitting and joining them, iteration all that fun stuff to be some of my favorite challenges in freeCodeCamp, it's just everything else that's the issue! I'm getting there just been quite bogged down with other things has been over a week since I've had a solid block of time to code like a good 4 hours is ideal for me. Tomorrow I should be able to make some good progress.

### Day 6: August 19, Sunday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Roman Numeral Converter, and Caesars Cipher on FreeCodeCamp, started the telephone number checker which I almost got working well, except it has such a large amount of test data and I keep failing at least 3 of them. But I've run out of time so will have a proper look next week. Tomorrow I'm back to C programming which fundly enough had a Caesar's cipher challenge a couple weeks ago!  

**Thoughts**: Not too much to say today, struggled to find time today as I don't normally code on Sunday. In the future I think I'll just do an hour on Sunday as Sunday tends to be my 'get everything I didn't do during the week done day' ie. housework and phone reminders, plus I kinda want to relax which I think is pretty normal for a Sunday. Nonetheless was a solid day and I'm pretty happy with my efforts.

### Day 7: August 20, Monday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished and checked the music program in CS50

**Thoughts**: Not much time today to do anything, but happy to have finished the music program now just a few final things to do before moving on to the next weeks work. 

### Day 8: August 21, Tuesday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Telephone number validator on Free Code Camp, very complex regular expression (At least out of what I've come across), but eventually figured out where I was going wrong, I needed to use the ? syntax to represent where there was 1 or 0 of something. Because of the sample data some options had 1 or 0 spaces, or 1 or zero hyphens etc. and both had to be accepted. 

**Thoughts**: Just managed to get my hour in today. Been a hectic few days, but loving the 100 days of code challenge, keeping me coding in amongst it all!

### Day 9: August 22, Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent the morning on the next unit in CS50 on edX, however did not do any coding as was watching the lecture and shorts. In the afternoon got in an hour of coding on Free Code Camp, maybe half way through the final Javascript challenge..

**Thoughts**: Actually quite proud of how far I got through this final challenge "Cash Register" before getting stumped. But not stumped because I don't know what to do next per se, but stumped because I completely misred part of the challenge, I didn't realise I needed to use the cash register values to return the change to give to the customer, I thought that was only for the other parts of the challenge. But of course I need to use the values! duh! anyway tomorrow I'll go back through my algorithm and adjust for using the cash register values instead. I'm just worried that I'll struggle with it. But not to worry I'll get there! 

### Day 10: August 23, Thursday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the freeCodeCamp challenge Cash Register. Took just as long to comment my code as it did to fix it after what I did yesterday!

**Thoughts**: Excited to move onto the next part of freeCodeCamp, however I feel I need to run through some of the challenges etc again before moving on to far.

### Day 11: August 24, Friday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Ran through the Bootstrap challenges on freeCodeCamp, was pretty enjoyable to see the simplicity of bootstrap and the amount a few lines of code can do. I also updated my website to reflect the new projects I'd done. 

**Thoughts**: I found the Bootstrap challenges fun however I'm a little uncomfortable about how much Bootstrap hides from someone learning web design and development. I appreciate it's an incredible resource, however it feels a little constrained like if you want to use bootstrap, you have use it throughout, it doesn't seem like you can just use it in some places. Maybe I'm wrong will investigate another day. I mean the responsive layout stuff is excellent. Also I'm having issues getting my website to not overflow by 10 pixels. I spent an hour investigating, however have not resolved. Annoying!

### Day 12: August 25, Saturday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Going back through the freeCodeCamp OO and functional programming sections to solidify my learning a bit. 

**Thoughts**: It's taking much longer than I expected, It's a little troubling how much I've forgotten from the first time around, however I also remember alot too so I guess it's just how learning works =P

### Day 13: August 26, Sunday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Brushing up on my functional programming in FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts**: That reduce function is one serious function!

### Day 14: August 27, Monday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished brushing up on my functional programming in FreeCodeCamp, now doing the JavaScript intermediate challenges again! 

**Thoughts**: The intermediate challenges, are, very hard.. but at the same time.. I thoroughly enjoy them.. especially when you realise, hang on! I can just do this instead of 100 lines of code! I feel like doing them again has been greatly helpful thus far.

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 14, Tuesday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the start of PSET3 from HarvardX CS50. Not to mention deciding to start the 100 Days of Code challenge

**Thoughts**:
Spent a bulk of the time understanding the requirements of PSET3 which requires the implementation of 3 helper functions to fill out the application for reading and playing music. I've implemented the first one, but by the time I read through the helper and associated C files, as well as write out the happy birthday song in ASCII I had to head off to work. However will continue tomorrow. 

I'm excited about working through the 100 Days Of Code challenge primarily to help me see how far I am travelling in my coding journey. I don't necessarily need the motivation or anything to keep me in check. But I'm finding myself getting discouraged when I finish a coding session and get far less done than planned. I look forward to using this challenge as something that encourages me and reminds me that I'm achieving and learning.

### Day 2: August 15, Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the bulk of PSET3 from HarvardX CS50. Generally speaking it was an uphill battle, that after 4 hours I completed the frequency function and it worked perfectly through running notes and it evaluated fine in check50. Only problem was I didn't implement the duration and is_rest functions 100% and now I'm out of time, so will try again next week! Back to FreeCodeCamp tomorrow.

**Thoughts**:
I found the work today to be very hard work. CS50 is thoroughly enjoyable and an incredible programming course. However it moves at quite a pace. I think it will take me a bit longer than the 11 weeks it says it runs for. But thats OK. My goal is to have it done by the end of the year. So I think I'll just aim for that at this stage! 

### Day 3: August 15, Wednesday, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fumbling through the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting exercises on FreeCodeCamp. I only had the 1 hour to spare today, and kinda feel a little bit disappointed with my efforts. However I did solidify (in part) my OO knowledge and learned more about return functions so that's something!  

**Thoughts**: The intermediate algorithm challenges, I'm finding are significantly harder than the basic ones. I'm often having to check the hints and in some cases, look at the solutions. As soon as I do that I completely understand it (I think!). Nonetheless, as soon as I've finished this section I'll be going straight back through it because I don't think it's wise to move onto the projects section coming up next if I can't do the intermediate challenges.
